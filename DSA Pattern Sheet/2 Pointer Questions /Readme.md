<h2>1. Running from both ends of an array</h2>
<br>
The first type of problem is, having two pointers at left and right end of array, then moving them to the center while processing something with them.<br>

<h2>2. Slow & Fast Pointers</h2>
<br>
Next type is using two pointers with different speed of movement. Typically they starts from the left end, then the first pointer advances fast and give some feedback to the slow pointer and do some calculation.

<h2>3.Running from the beginning of 2 arrays / Merging 2 arrays</h2>
In this category, you will be given 2 arrays or lists, and then have to process them with individual pointers.

<h2>4.Split & Merge of an array / Divide & Conquer</h2>
<br>
The last one is similar to the previous category but there is one thing is added. First, you need to split the given list into 2 separate lists and then do 2 pointers approach to merge or unify them. There aren't many tasks here.
